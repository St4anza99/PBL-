# Smart Posture Checking system

> A quick, Arduino‐based IoT project that sounds a buzzer when you slouch in your chair or lean too far back. A one-press mute that automatically re-arms the system after you manually disable the notification for whatever reason you may need to. When in a good sitting position, the LED stays on.

# Features
#
**Ultrasonic sensing** | HC-SR04 checks back and neck position every 200 ms
**Active buzzer + LED** | Instant visual & audible alert for good or bad posture
**Push-button override** | One press silences the alert until user wants to maintain good posture again
**Self-reset** | Alarm re-enables automatically once bad posture is detected again
**Minimal parts** | No extra resistors except the LED’s 330 Ω series resistor
**Open-source** | GNU-licensed code, schematic and report included
